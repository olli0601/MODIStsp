    ### Test 1: test of the basic operations of MODIStsp. ###
    #   The test downloads two bands and extract one quality indicator from a single locale
    #   LST product (MOD11A2, Newfoundland), without any additional preprocessing operation.
    #   Output files are in GeoTiff format.
    cat("Test 1: basic extraction of bands and quality indicators\n")
    MODIStsp(test = 1)
    MODIStest_check_md5(test = 1)

    ### Test 2: test of geometric routines. ###
    #   The test works on the same local product of test 1, performing geometric operations
    #   (clipping on the extent of Avalon peninsula and resampling resolution to 1000m.
    #   Output files are in ENVI format.
    cat("Test 2: geometric operations\n")
    MODIStsp(test = 2)
    MODIStest_check_md5(test = 2)

    ### Test 3: test of the creation of spectral indices and time series. ###
    #   The test works on a SR local product (MOD09A1) clipped on a small region (Barbellino,
    #   Orobie Alps) and creates two defined spectral indices (NDVI and SAVI) and one custom
    #   index (GVMI). Geometric operations are performed like in test 2 (with a resampling to
    #   250m resolution using mode), and processing options for time series creation are applied.
    #   Output files are in GeoTiff compressed format, with vrt time series.
    cat("Test 3: spectral indices and creation of time series\n")
    expect_warning(MODIStsp(test = 3))
    MODIStest_check_md5(test = 3)

    ### Test 4: test of HTTP download (from NSIDC) with seasonal period. ###
    #   This test downloads two snow cover products (MYD10CM) of 1st August of years 2015 and 2016,
    #   applying geometric operations (clipping on Svalbard islands and reprojecting
    #   in Arctic Polar Stereographic projection).
    #   Output files and time series are in ENVI format.
    #   FIXME the test requires valid USGS credentials, which are asked in
    #   interactive mode. For this reason the test is excluded from testthat routines,
    #   and must be runned manually.
    cat("Test 4: HTTP download from NSIDC and seasonal download\n")
    cat("(skipped)\n")
    # MODIStsp(test = 4)
    # MODIStest_check_md5(test = 4)

    ### Test 5: test of HTTP download (from USGS). ###
    #   This test downloads an albedo product (MCD43A3), clipping (Cape Verde islands)
    #   and reprojecting it (Cape Verde National CRS).
    #   Output files and time series are in ENVI format.
    #   FIXME the test requires valid USGS credentials, which are asked in
    #   interactive mode. For this reason the test is excluded from testthat routines,
    #   and must be runned manually.

    cat("(skipped)\n")
    # MODIStsp(test = 5)
    # MODIStest_check_md5(test = 5)

    ### Test 6: test of FTP download and union of MODIS tiles ###
    #   This test download four LAI products (MCD15A2H) from FTP and merge them in a clipped
    #   overlapping area (Minorca island).
    #   After reprojection in geographic coordinates, output files are exported as GeoTiff
    #   (scaling output values) and vrt time series are created.
