\title{create MODIStsp virtual time series}
\usage{
MODIStsp_vrt_create(out_prod_folder, meta_band, file_prefixes, sens_sel,
  ts_format, nodata_value, out_format, rts)
}
\arguments{
\item{out_prod_folder}{string main output folder}

\item{meta_band}{string "name" of the band (or index, or qi) for which the
virtual file is to be created}

\item{file_prefixes}{string file_prefixes for terra and aqua - used to identify
the files corresponding to each sensor}

\item{sens_sel}{string name of the sensor for which the time serie has to be
created (Aqua, Terra, Mixed) If "Mixed" and both terra and aqua
images are available, a "mixed" virtual file comprising data from both sensors
ordered on DOY base is created}

\item{ts_format}{string required output format for virtual file (ENVI, GDAL, Both)}

\item{nodata_value}{string nodata value to be used for vrt files
(equal to nodata value of inputs)}

\item{out_format}{format of images used as "input" for the vrt and contained
in out_prod_folder/band folders (ENVI or GTiff)}

\item{rts}{string ("Yes"/"No") If Yes, create rts time series}
}
\value{
NULL - virtual files are stored in the "Time Series" subfolder of out_prod_folder
}
\description{
Function used to create virtual files from time series of single-band
files corresponding to different acquisition dates
}
\details{
The function takes as input the folder in which the single-band files are
stored, and cretes a ENVI Meta file and/or a GDAL vrt file that allows access to
the full time series as if it was a single physical file
