\title{MODIStsp}
\usage{
MODIStsp(gui = TRUE, options_file = NULL, spatial_file_path = NULL,
  scroll_window = FALSE, test = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{gui}{logical parameter (TRUE: the GUI is opened before processing; FALSE: the
saved parameters are retrieved from "options_file")}

\item{options_file}{settings (optional): full path of the JSON file containing the
processing options (default: MODIStsp_Previous.json in subdir Previous);}

\item{spatial_file_path}{(optional): full path of a spatial file to use as extent
(default=NULL): if defined, the processing options which define the extent, the
selected tiles and the "Full Tile / Resized" options are not considered; instead, new
files are created on the extent of the provided spatial file.}

\item{scroll_window}{(optional) logical parameter: if TRUE, the GUI window is opened
fullscreen with scrollbars (this is useful on devices with small display). If using a
device with a display resolution >= 1024x768, leaving this parameter to FALSE is
suggested.}

\item{test}{(optional) integer: if set, the tool is run in test mode, using a
preset Option File instead than opening the GUI or accepting the option_file parameter.
The number indicates which preset file to be used (five files are available).
If test=0, the files sis selected randomly. Default value (-1) indicates that the
tool is executed normally (not in test mode).
This modality is useful to test the tool in case of errors.}

\description{
Main function for the MODIS Time Series Processing Tool (MODIStsp)
}
\details{
The function is used to initialize the processing (folder names, packages,
etc.), to launch the GUI (MODIStsp_GUI) and receive its outputs, and to launch the
required routines for downloading and processing the requested datasets.

# Running the tool without any option will start the GUI with the default or last used

# Run the tool using the settings previously saved in a specific option file
\dontrun{
MODIStsp(gui = FALSE, options_file = "X:/yourpath/youroptions.json")}

# Run the tool using a previously saved options file,
# but editing it with the GUI before starting the processing

# Run the tool using the settings previously saved in a specific option file
# and specifying the extent from a spatial file

  spatial_file_path = "X:/yourpath/yourspatialfile.shp" )}

# Run the tool in a batch mode, using the settings previously saved in a specific
# option file and specifying each time the extent from a different spatial file
